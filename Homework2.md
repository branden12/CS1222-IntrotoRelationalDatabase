## Purpose

Purpose 

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate knowledge of the basic syntax of a SQL query. Specifically, you will be asked to demonstrate:

- use of the SELECT clause to specify which fields you want to query

- use of the FROM clause to specify which tables you want to query, and 

- use of the WHERE clause to specify which conditions the query will use to query rows in a table.

These are the basic commands that will make up your foundational knowledge of SQL. There are other clauses besides SELECT, FROM, and WHERE, but by building up your knowledge of these basic clauses, you will have constructed a foundation upon which to base your knowledge of SQL.
