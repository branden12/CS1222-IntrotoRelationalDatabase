## Purpose

The goal of this module is to learn how to use functions to better massage your data.

## Knowledge

Functions are a powerful tool that gives you more control over how to display data from your queries. Functions have a similar syntax to aggregations. However, while aggregations allow you to perform variety of operations on several rows to return a single result, functions allow you to perform an operation on each row in a query result. 
## Tasks

#### Refer to the MySQL Setup assignment to refresh your memory.
