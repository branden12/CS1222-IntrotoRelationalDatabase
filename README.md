## Purpose

The goal of this module is to introduce yourself to the basics of NoSQL and familiarize yourselves with the differences between Relational databases and NoSQL databases.
## Tasks

### N/A

#### Please use a "find()" query after every problem so that I can see your changes easily in your database.

- Create two new restaurants. Insert them into your new database. Fill out all information about the restaurant, as seen in the insert example above.

- Update the two restaurants that you just inserted to have addresses of "123 Fake Street" for the first restaurant, and "456 Not Fake Avenue" for the second. You will need to use two update queries for this question.

- Delete the two restaurants from the database.
